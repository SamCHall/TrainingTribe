# TrainingTribe

This repository is for a Social Fitness Mobile app called **TrainingTribe**. This will be used to conduct an experiment on the gamification of fitness and how a clan-based app can affect motivation to workout. **React Native** using the **Expo CLI** is used to deliver this to both apple and android devices.

## Installing

To run the code, you will need to have npm installed and run the following command within the command line:
```
npm install
```

This project is using **Expo** and requires a custom build using **EAS**. Please see the documentation [here](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/) for information on how to create a development build to view.

Once the development build is installed, use the following command to create a local server:
```
npx expo start --dev-client 
```
You should then see the live server within the development build app.
